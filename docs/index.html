So the scene is composed by a ground and 4 walls (I created an empty game object that parented them), on this board game I added a ball that will be our player and cubes that will be our collectibles.</p></div>

Just by looking at the scheme on the gear level we instantly know how to use it.

Firstly I think AR is here to help us in our daily but I also think it has to be intuitive and look cool in order to be use often. My first Idea would be a kind of augmented mirror.
